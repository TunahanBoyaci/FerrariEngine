## Overview
This repository introduces a Java application focused on engines used in Formula 1 racing. The code creates instances of FerrariEngine and RenaultEngine classes with specific parameters, representing different engine models. These engine objects are stored in an ArrayList called "engines". By iterating through the engines and printing their maximum speeds, users can obtain information about the performance characteristics of various Formula 1 engines. This application offers a concise demonstration of managing and comparing different engine models used in the sport.
